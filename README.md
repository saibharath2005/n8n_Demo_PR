### GitHub Pull Request Automation with n8n

This project demonstrates how n8n can be used to automate GitHub Pull Request workflows.
Whenever a pull request is created or updated, the automation is triggered using GitHub webhooks.
The workflow analyzes PR details such as title, description, and changed files.

AI integration can generate PR summaries, perform basic code checks, or suggest improvements.

Based on the analysis, the system can automatically add labels, assign reviewers, or post comments.
This automation reduces manual effort, improves review consistency, and speeds up the development lifecycle.
